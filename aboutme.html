                    About Veldboom Studios
                    Our Journey
                    From a young age, our founder, Shaquille Veldboom, has been engrossed in the world of 3D design. His
                    journey
                    began at the tender age of eight, leading to him amassing over 30,000 hours in this craft and
                    gaining 17
                    years of experience in the field. Born and raised in Amsterdam Southeast, a low-income,
                    predominantly
                    black
                    community, Shaquille found his passion in 3D design and used it as a tool to transcend his
                    circumstances​​.<br>
                    <br>
                    Shaquille’s journey wasn’t traditional. He left college three times as it didn’t resonate with his
                    learning
                    style or creative process. Despite this, he became an in-demand 3D designer, applying his skills to
                    industrial design, game design, animation, and music​​.<br>
                    <br>
                    Today, Shaquille leads Veldboom Studios, pushing the boundaries of creativity and technological
                    innovation.
                    His ability to visualize and create without constraints has set the studio apart, making it a leader
                    in
                    3D
                    design, 3D printing, gamification, and web 3.0 solutions.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
