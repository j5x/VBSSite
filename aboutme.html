        <h3>Our Journey</h3>
        <p>
            From a young age, our founder, Shaquille Veldboom, has been engrossed in the world of 3D design.
            His journey began at the tender age of eight, leading to him amassing over 30,000 hours in this craft and
            gaining 17 years of experience in the field.
            Born and raised in Amsterdam Southeast, a low-income, predominantly black community,
            Shaquille found his passion in 3D design and used it as a tool to transcend his circumstancesâ€‹.
